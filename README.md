## Introduction

This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI for a Weather-Journal App.

## Development Strategy

- For this project, you will be writing most of your code in two files: `server.js` and `website/app.js`. Note that it's very important that you plan your project before you start writing any code! Break your project down into small pieces of work and strategize your approach to each one. With these bite-sized amounts, it'll be easier to debug and fix any issues that appear.
- Feel free to implement your own design workflow, but if you get stuck -- here is a walkthrough to get you up and running! 
- Start by setting up your project environment. Make sure Node is installed from the terminal. Install the packages Express, Body-Parser, and Cors from the terminal and include them in your `server.js` file.
- Create a server running on the port of your choosing. Add a console.log() to the server callback function, and test that your server is running using Node in the terminal to run the file server.js
- Add a GET route that returns the projectData object in your server code Then, add a POST route that adds incoming data to projectData.
- The POST route should anticipate receiving three pieces of data from the request body
```
{
    "temperature"
    "date"
    "user response"
}
```
- Make sure your POST route is setup to add each of these values with a key to projectData.
- Acquire API credentials from OpenWeatherMap website. Use your credentials and the base url to create global variables at the top of your app.js code.
- Write an async function in app.js that uses fetch() to make a GET request to the OpenWeatherMap API.
- Create an event listener for the element with the id: generate, with a callback function to execute when it is clicked.
- Inside that callback function call your async GET request with the parameters:
```
{
    base url: https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?zip=
    user entered zip code (see input in html with id zip): 2210413
    personal API key: &appid=b0df923fe22b20b64ac181d4eb968f81&units=imperial
}
```
Rubric Tip: This step will help you to pass the rubric item "Integrating OpenWeatherMap API."

- After your successful retrieval of the weather data, you will need to chain another Promise that makes a POST request to add the API data, as well as data entered by the user, to your app.
- You will need to write another async function to make this POST request.
- The function should receive a path and a data object.
- The data object should include
```
{
    temperature
    date
    user response
}
```
- Remember, you can access the value of DOM elements by selecting them in your JS code.
- Finally, chain another Promise that updates the UI dynamically Write another async function that is called after the completed POST request. This function should retrieve data from our app, select the necessary elements on the DOM (index.html), and then update their necessary values to reflect the dynamic values for:
```
{
    Temperature
    Date
    User input
}
```
